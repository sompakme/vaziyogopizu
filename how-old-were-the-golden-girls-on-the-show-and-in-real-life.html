For this reason, the ages of the Golden Girls have remained a mystery both on the show and in real life.</p><h2>How old were the Golden Girls on the show?</h2><p class=align-left><i>The Golden Girls </i>sitcom attracted fans of all ages.

She was the second character to join the show. Blanche was so adamant about hiding her age that she had it deleted from the government's official records. Rose tried to dig through files at once, only to find that the Authority of the Governor had erased Devereaux's age records.</p><p class=align-left>How old was Rue McClanahan in <i>Golden Girls?</i> The mystery of Rue McClanahan's age on the show became a running joke. However, there was a few clues about how old she was. In Season 2, Episode 1 (<i>End of the Curse</i>), Blanche thinks she might be pregnant and says she will be 65 when the child graduates high school. If the child graduates at 17, then Blanche (Rue McClanahan) was 48 in that episode and 47 at the start of the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5d26542242b2a135.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 oldest living celebrities: famous people who are well over 90</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, this assumption was thrown out in Season 3, Episode 25, dubbed <i><a id="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0589784/trivia?ref_=ttqu_sa_1" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mother's Day</a></i>.
