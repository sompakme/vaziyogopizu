The series follows the story of Shouko Komi, a beautiful and quiet girl who suffers from a communication disorder that prevents her from making friends. With the help of Hitohito Tadano, an ordinary boy who can understand her, she embarks on a quest to achieve her goal of having 100 friends.</p><p>The anime adaptation of Komi Can’t Communicate was produced by OLM, a studio known for its work on Pokemon and other anime franchises. The first season of the anime premiered on Netflix on October 21, 2021, and consisted of 12 episodes. The second season was announced shortly after the first season’s finale and is scheduled to air on Netflix in early 2022.</p><p>But what about the third season of Komi Can’t Communicate? Will there be more episodes of this charming and heartwarming anime? Here is everything we know so far about the possible release date, plot, cast, and trailer of <a href=#>Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Komi_Cant_Communicate_Season_3_Release_Date></span>Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3 Release Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of October 27, 2023, there has been no official confirmation or announcement regarding the renewal or cancellation of Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3. However, this does not mean that the anime series is over for good. There are several factors that could influence the decision to greenlight a third season of Komi Can’t Communicate, such as:</p><ul><li>The popularity and reception of the anime series among fans and critics. Komi Can’t Communicate has received positive reviews from both audiences and critics, who praised its animation, humor, characters, and message. The anime series has an impressive audience score of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes and a high rating of 8.5/10 on IMDb. The anime series also has a loyal fan base that expresses their love and support for the show on social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram.</li><li>The availability and demand of the source material. Komi Can’t Communicate is based on the manga series by Tomohito Oda, which has been serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine since May 2016. As of October 2021, the manga series has 27 volumes published, with over six million copies in circulation. The manga series also won the 67th Shogakukan Manga Award in the shonen category in 2022. The anime series has covered only a fraction of the manga series so far, which means that there is plenty of material left to adapt for future seasons.</li><li>The profitability and budget of the anime production. Komi Can’t Communicate is licensed by Netflix for worldwide streaming, which gives it a wider reach and exposure than most anime shows. Netflix is known for investing heavily in original and exclusive content, especially in the anime genre. Netflix has produced and distributed several successful anime shows such as Castlevania, Beastars, The Seven Deadly Sins, and The Promised Neverland. Netflix also has a partnership with OLM, the studio behind Komi Can’t Communicate, which could facilitate the production and distribution of more seasons.</li></ul><p>Based on these factors, we can conclude that there is a high chance that Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3 will be made eventually. However, we cannot predict when exactly it will happen or how long it will take. Anime productions usually take several months or even years to complete, depending on various factors such as scheduling, staffing, quality control, and marketing.</p><p>Therefore, we can only speculate that Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3 will be released sometime in <strong>late 2024 or early 2025</strong> <strong>at the earliest</strong>. This is assuming that the anime production will start soon after the second season’s completion and that there will be no major delays or complications along the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Komi-Cant-Communicate-Season-3-Plot.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Plot></span>Plot <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The plot of Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3 will depend on how much the second season will cover from the manga series. However, we can expect that the third season will continue to follow the adventures and misadventures of Komi and Tadano as they meet new friends and face new challenges in their school life.</p><p>Some of the possible plot points that could be explored in the third season are:</p><ul><li>The introduction of new characters such as Naruse Osana (a childhood friend of Tadano who has a crush on him), Katai Makoto (a former delinquent who becomes friends with Komi), Shinobino Momo (a ninja girl who admires Komi), and Onemine Nene (a friendly and cheerful girl who helps Komi).</li><li>The development of the romantic relationships between Komi and Tadano, as well as between other characters such as Najimi and Agari, Yamai and Kometani, and Otori and Ase.</li><li>The celebration of various events and festivals such as Valentine’s Day, White Day, Christmas, New Year, and the school festival.</li><li>The exploration of Komi’s family background and history, as well as her interactions with her parents and siblings.</li><li>The graduation of Komi and Tadano from middle school and their transition to high school.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Komi-Cant-Communicate-Season-3-Cast.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast_Voice_Actors></span>Cast, Voice Actors <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The cast of Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3 will likely consist of the same voice actors who voiced the characters in the previous seasons. The cast includes:</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Character</th><th>Voice Actors</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Shouko Komi</td><td>Aoi Koga</td></tr><tr><td>Hitohito Tadano</td><td>Gakuto Kajiwara</td></tr><tr><td>Najimi Osana</td><td>Rie Murakawa</td></tr><tr><td>Shouko Komi (young)</td><td>Yukiyo Fujii</td></tr><tr><td>Shousuke Komi</td><td>Yuuki Kaji</td></tr><tr><td>Shouko’s mother</td><td>Aya Endo</td></tr><tr><td>Shouko’s father</td><td>Hiroshi Kamiya</td></tr><tr><td>Agari Himiko</td><td>Yui Horie</td></tr><tr><td>Ren Yamai</td><td>Rina Hidaka</td></tr><tr><td>Kometani Akako</td><td>Yuu Serizawa</td></tr><tr><td>Shuuko Katai</td><td>Junya Enoki</td></tr><tr><td>Nene Onemine</td><td>Ayane Sakura</td></tr><tr><td>Momo Shinobino</td><td>Saori Hayami</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trailer></span>Trailer <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no trailer for Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3 yet, since the anime series has not been officially renewed or announced. However, you can watch the trailer for the second season of Komi Can’t Communicate below, which features the opening song “Kimi to Boku no Uta” by Miku Ito.</p><p><strong>Trailer</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catastrophic Necromancer Chapter 30</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_can_we_watch></span>Where can we watch<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The most obvious answer to this question is Netflix, the online streaming platform that has licensed the anime series for worldwide distribution. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Netflix released the first season of 14 episodes</a> on October 21, 2021, and is expected to release the second season in early 2022. Netflix is also the most likely platform to release the third season of Komi Can’t Communicate if it ever happens.</p><p>However, Netflix is not the only platform where you can watch Komi Can’t Communicate. In Japan, the anime series is broadcast on TV Tokyo and other channels, and you can also watch it online on Bilibili, a video-sharing platform that offers anime, comics, games, and more. However, you may need a VPN or a proxy to access these platforms from outside Japan.</p><p>If you are a fan of Komi Can’t Communicate, you can also read the manga series by Tomohito Oda, which is the original source material for the anime adaptation. The manga series has been serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine since May 2016, and it has 27 volumes published as of October 2021. You can read the manga series online on Viz Media or Shonen Jump app, or buy physical copies from Amazon or other bookstores.</p><p>Komi Can’t Communicate Season 3 is not confirmed yet, but there is a high possibility that it will happen in the future. The anime series has been well-received by fans and critics alike, and there is still plenty of source material to adapt from the manga series. We can only hope that Netflix and OLM will announce the renewal of the anime series soon and give us more episodes of this adorable and hilarious anime.</p><p>Until then, we can enjoy the second season of Komi Can’t Communicate on Netflix and rewatch the first season if we miss our favorite characters. We can also read the manga series by Tomohito Oda to catch up with the latest developments in the story. And we can join the online community of fans who share their love and appreciation for this amazing anime series.</p><p>Komi Can’t Communicate is a heartwarming and funny anime series that teaches us about the importance of friendship, communication, and acceptance. It also shows us that everyone has their own struggles and insecurities, but they can overcome them with the help of others. It is an anime series that will make you laugh, cry, and smile with its charming and relatable characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGiYp6Gdmnysu8yiZJyZnql6pLvMpqynoZOWwaZ50p6YrKeeYoBuvsSlnJqrlWKxosDEaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./shannon-sharpe-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>&#171;&nbsp;Shannon Sharpe Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a>
