Almost out of nowhere, an ancient technique or practice suddenly becomes mainstream, and the next thing you know, everyone is doing it. That's kind of how gua sha — an ancient Chinese remedy of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin massaging</a> using a unique handheld tool — became a viral beauty sensation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Gua sha has been part of traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years and incorporates tools like horn, stone, and jade to scrape the skin,” says acupuncturist Elizabeth Trattner. Gua sha is so beloved that some proponents are swearing off Botox in favor of the facial massage, claiming it provides similar benefits. But can sliding a piece of stone across the skin really do the same job as injectables and fillers? To find out, we enlisted the help of Trattner, plastic surgeon Eunice Park, and dermatologist Dendy Engleman.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elizabeth Trattner</a> is an acupuncture physician and a doctor of integrative and Chinese medicine.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Eunice Park</a>, MD, is a board-certified facial plastic surgeon based in Long Island, NY.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Dendy Engelman</a>, MD, is a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist and Mohs surgeon in New York City.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to see whether gua sha can get rid of forehead wrinkles, according to experts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-gua-sha></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Gua Sha?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A gua sha facial massage involves gently scraping the skin with firm, upward strokes. This wakes up the lymphatic system, increases blood circulation, and diminishes toxins and excess fluid to reduce puffiness. Dr. Park explains that the manual pressure used with a gua sha tool also releases underlying muscle tension, similar to the relief we experience from a neck or shoulder massage. "This can be especially helpful for people who suffer from temporomandibular joints and jawline clenching or tightness."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Engelman, gua sha is "a nice opportunity to check in with ourselves and take a moment for self-care in the morning or evening." It also offers some pretty stellar beauty and anti-aging benefits. "Gua sha ... has dramatic effects on lifting and sculpting the face ... and creating a healthy glow," Trattner adds. Over time and with consistent use, it can also help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gua-sha-vs-botox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gua Sha vs. Botox</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though both gua sha and Botox can improve the look of lines, wrinkles, and an aging face, Dr. Park says gua sha and Botox should never be referred to as the same. "They have unique mechanisms of action. For example, gua sha can stimulate blood flow to the skin and help reduce puffiness and edema, but it will not magically erase wrinkles and expression lines." Gua sha reinvigorates stagnant tissues sans any needles, injections, or chemical response.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gua sha relies on pressure, massage, and anti-inflammatory scraping to work the muscle and tissue and get stagnant blood flowing again to revive the skin. Botox (and the like) employ neurotoxins that, when injected, block out signals from the nerve to the muscle that are needed to contract. Reducing or eliminating these contractions and facial expressions softens the lines and wrinkles that become ingrained in the skin.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>@wildling_beauty / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another difference: Neuromodulators kick in after a few days to one week, while gua sha improves the look of the skin over the long run. However, you'll likely need to use a gua sha consistently for months before seeing a difference because it takes time to unblock stagnant blood and lymph flow. "Getting the lymphatic system and blood circulation moving helps lead to healthier and younger-looking skin, and with regular use, it can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines," Dr. Engelman says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gua-sha-as-a-botox-alternative></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gua Sha as a Botox Alternative</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While there may be some instances where gua sha can be a more natural alternative to filler, the results will never be identical to what an injectable can accomplish. "I think gua sha is a relaxing part of a skincare routine, but I don't think it should be considered a direct substitute for Botox and fillers," Dr. Park says. Instead, she prefers clinically effective treatments — like chemical peels, laser facials, and microneedling treatments for those who are not yet ready for injections or want to avoid them altogether.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you follow a steadfast gua sha routine, it won't erase fine lines and wrinkles with the same efficacy as Botox and other injectables. "Neurotoxins, like Botox, are clinically proven to relax the underlying facial muscles that cause dynamic wrinkles, lasting about three months," Dr. Park shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, there may be long-term benefits with consistent gua sha use, but, according to Dr. Park, these effects are difficult to quantify. “Gua sha will always yield a much milder result,” Dr. Engelman adds. But if you're okay with that, then gua sha may be the right choice.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-to-use-gua-sha-after-injectables></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When to Use Gua Sha After Injectables</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How long should you wait after a trip to your dermatologist before resuming your regular gua sha routine? It comes down to what you had done, where, and how much product was injected. Dr. Engelman recommends waiting about one week before using a gua sha, ensuring that any swelling or bruising has subsided.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"By this point, the neuromodulator has had enough time to settle and take effect." If you want to take a more cautious approach, you can wait another week — two weeks is recommended for fillers — or up to one month. Always use caution in delicate areas such as the under eyes, lips and nose to avoid displacing the filler. "Consult your injector about best practices immediately post-filler placement since filler injection is highly customized to the individual," Dr. Park says.</p><p>Perform gua sha with a serum, oil, or cream. This allows the instrument to glide effortlessly across the skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Botox and Neuromodulators</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using a gua sha (or any other facial tool or massaging device, for that matter) too soon after injections, especially Botox and neuromodulators, can potentially hinder the results, shorten their duration, or even affect the appearance. "You could end up with asymmetry in your face and areas of unwanted swelling or [drooping], which takes time to fade," says Dr. Engelman. In other cases, you might move the neuromodulator to your eyelid or eye area — which can cause more serious complications that take weeks or months to heal or require treatment, she shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pressure put on the face during gua sha massage is another reason to steer clear of it post-injections. Trattner recommends always using delicate pressure, especially on the neck, since excessive force can dislodge a clot. As if that's not enough, it's normal for an injection site to be tender to the touch, bruised, and even swollen, and facial massage may create discomfort in the area. Dr. Engelman says that using gua sha (and other at-home tools) incorrectly or too frequently can harm the skin. "Using too much force or pulling on or tugging the skin roughly can irritate the skin and cause bruising and broken blood vessels."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sculptra</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Certain injectables, like Sculptura, come with even more specific gua sha cautions. "I say to hold off for a good month or two so that the product can work to make more collagen," Trattner shares. The same goes for filler injected along the sides of the face and in the jawline, which tends to experience minor swelling. As tempting as it may be to gua sha these areas to release unwanted puffiness, don't. "Instead, what can help is gua sha on the neck and décolletage to facilitate lymphatic drainage and to open and move the meridians of the neck and face," Trattner suggests. "This will help the face drain naturally and expedite healing."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Kybella</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kybella is one injectable where gua sha can make a significant difference post-treatment. "It can be beneficial several weeks after receiving Kybella injections because gua sha helps the fascia move back together and facilitates the drainage of the neck and lower jaw. However, it is imperative to have this done by a cosmetic acupuncturist only. Otherwise, you can make matters worse," Trattner explains. "I have seen substantially improved healing after Kybella but do not advise gua sha at home for this purpose."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's still nothing like the OG wrinkle reducer, Botox, but a solid and consistent gua sha routine can come in as a close second. While the results from gua sha won't be identical to those of Botox and other neuromodulators, it definitely won't hurt to use one, and it can even improve the skin and facial contours. Just know what each treatment is capable of doing and not doing, whether you choose to go the route of the needle or a scraping tool.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-4e68620e-5ad2-4952-84dd-5755f6dad8a9></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the health benefits of gua sha?</span></p><p>Performing regular gua sha treatments can&nbsp;improve blood circulation, relax muscles, help your skin detox, reduce inflammation, and provide stress relief.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the downsides of gua sha?</span></p><p>Your face will experience initial redness, which is a result of improved circulation.
