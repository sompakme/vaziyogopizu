What happened at the Tokyo Olympics might have surprised hardcore fans and spectators alike, but Biles has never shied away from difficult subjects that mean a lot to her. From her record-breaking performances to her disclosure that she's one of the gymnasts who survived early sexual abuse, she's stayed authentically herself.

If it's not your decision, you're not having fun, and if you're not having fun, you might not enjoy it. If you're having fun, that's when the best memories are built."</p><h2 id=usa-today-2016-3>USA Today, 2016</h2><p>On getting&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/rio-2016/2016/06/02/simone-biles-expectations-rio/85298782/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>competition experience</a>: “A successful competition for me is always going out there and putting 100 percent into whatever I’m doing.

Whenever you’re up there, it feels like it’s just you, your team, and your equipment. Before I go out and compete, my mom always says ‘be the best, Simone,’ but other than that, there’s nothing special that I do. I’m just myself.”</p><h2 id=vogue-2020-6>Vogue, 2020</h2><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vogue.com/article/simone-biles-cover-august-2020 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>young women who look up to her</a>: "No matter how good you are in your sport, in life, in work, the number one thing people talk about is how you look ... You’re still going to thrive. You’re going to become somebody amazing and great. You guys are all beautiful, inside and out.”</p><p>"Growing up, I didn’t see very many Black gymnasts ... So whenever I did, I felt really inspired to go out there and want to be as good as them. I remember watching Gabby Douglas win the 2012 Olympics, and I was like,&nbsp;If she can do it, I can do it.”</p><p>On holding gymnast officials accountable: “Personally, for me, I don’t think of it as an obligation ... I think of it as an honor to speak for the less fortunate and for the voiceless. I also feel like it gives them power.”<br></p><p>“We can’t feel comfortable promoting our sport if we fear that something might happen like this again because they’re not doing their part. And the hardest part for us is we’ve always done our part. We’ve always represented the U.S. to the best of our ability, and all the time, most of the time, every time I’ve represented, come back with gold medals. It’s like:&nbsp;We’ve done our part. Come on.”</p><h2 id=new-york-times-2021-3>New York Times, 2021</h2><p>Discussing going to the Olympics after&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/24/sports/olympics/simone-biles-gymnastics.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>speaking out about her abuse</a>: “I’m going to go out there and represent the U.S.A., represent World Champions Centre, and represent Black and brown girls over the world...At the end of the day, I’m not representing U.S.A.

And that's my problem: when people kind of harp on other people that are good at something. And it's like, everybody can say you're good, but once you acknowledge it, it's not cool anymore. And I want kids to learn that, yes, it's okay to acknowledge that you're good or even great at something."</p><h2 id=tokyo-olympics-2021-3>Tokyo Olympics, 2021</h2><p>On pulling out of the team final: "I have to put my pride aside.
