‘Honey Badger’ Cummins has spoken out amid backlash surrounding his conduct on Channel 7’s SAS Australia.</p><p>The former rugby player’s involvement in the reality show has sparked controversy among viewers concerned by his brutal interactions with female recruits.</p><p>In episode one, Cummins, 33, went head-to-head in a boxing match with AFLW star Sabrina Frederick and certainly didn’t hold back. In episode two, he went on to tackle Australian swimmer Shayna Jack so hard <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=d17c295717475f22adbec038d2abab97 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>she feared she had a broken rib.</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=#>Sharing an interview by fellow contestant Erin McNaught</a> on Channel 7’s <i>The Morning Show</i> today<i>, </i>Cummins wrote: “What happens on ground sometimes isn’t always what you see. With that said, I appreciate everyone’s concern around the topic.”</p><p>It comes after McNaught revealed what wasn’t shown during SAS Australia’s most controversial scene in defence of Cummins’ actions.</p><p>In <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c4ea2bf90c19f323de24365f6a66db6e data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>episode one’s intense boxing match</a>, AFLW player Frederick was told she could pick her opponent, and she stunned her co-stars and viewers at home when she picked Cummins.</p><p>The confronting fight scene sparked a fierce debate in Australia about whether or not Cummins should have gone as hard as he did or even agreed to the fight in the first place.</p><p>But as McNaught revealed on <i>The Morning Show</i>, the incident played out a little differently in real life as opposed to what viewers saw on TV.</p><p>“What they didn’t show is that Nick was actually really hesitant to hit Sabrina initially,” McNaught said. “The DS (directing staff) were just shouting at him, ‘Hit her! Hit her!’ And then she’s gone in for him.</p><p>“It actually really upsets me when people are targeting Nick about this because we did what we had to do,” she said. “If we didn’t do what we were told to do, we’d get kicked off. It’s as simple as that.”</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=a63407dc7748781fc82cab3e25d6363d data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>Mark ‘Billy’ Billingham defends Nick Cummins after fight</a></b></p><p><i>SAS Australia’s</i> chief instructor Ant Middleton spoke about the controversial fight on Nova’s <i>Fitzy and Wippa</i> this morning.</p><p>“The fight went on for a good couple of minutes,” Middleton said. “When she picked the Honey Badger I was like, ‘Wow let’s see how this goes.’</p><p>“She did get a beating and people were expecting me to stop it. (But) I could see her getting stronger and stronger. By the end of it the Honey Badger was stuffed.”</p><p><b>BACKLASH</b></p><p>After the episode aired, Frederick spoke to <i><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=nick-cummins-boxes-aflw-player-leaving-people-in-tears-c-1414088 data-tgev-label=sport data-tgev-metric=ev>Seven News</a></i> about the incident and thanked Cummins for fighting her.</p><p>“I volunteered first and I picked Nick for two reasons,” she said. “Firstly, I wanted to select the person I thought was the biggest challenge. Secondly, I knew our respect was mutual and he would give me a fair fight, regardless of my gender.</p><p>“In battle, the enemy doesn’t care about your gender or size and we had to think like soldiers to get through each and every task.</p><p>“Yes, I was scared but that’s the whole point of SAS selection – not letting the fear consume you and instead harnessing it to empower you.</p><p>“I am truly grateful for Nick and for that experience.”</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=5f856178899f8607c746ce4d50f961dc data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>SAS Australia instructor blasts Firass Dirani</a></b></p><p>But despite the fact Frederick picked Cummins, some viewers felt uneasy about the clash.</p><p>The most vocal critic was singer and domestic violence campaigner Guy Sebastian. He said in an interview that he “felt quite sick” watching the episode.</p><p>“My wife and I run a foundation where we deal with domestic violence,” he said on Nova 93.7’s <i>Nathan, Nat & Shaun</i> show. “I thought that was pretty p**s poor, if I’m being honest.</p><p>“I think it makes it very difficult to tell your kids, to tell your boy, ‘You never hit a girl. It doesn’t matter what the circumstance is, you just never, ever hit a girl. Violence against women is always wrong.’”</p><p>Sebastian also commented on the show on Twitter, writing: “I’ve met Nick (Cummins) and he’s a top bloke. I don’t have an issue with any individual on the show.</p><p>“I stand by my opinion because I’m entitled to it. They were told to bash each other, and to keep going even if the opponent was on the ground. I personally didn’t like what I saw. I understand all sides of the argument when it comes to actual SAS training, combat sports etc.</p><p>“In a martial arts gym, they are not told to smash someone even if they are on the ground. IMO (in my opinion) just because ‘she asked for it’ by choosing him doesn’t make it OK. In the DV space the line for ‘she asked for it’ is extremely varied so when it comes to entertainment, great caution.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=30dd0abddc619ec72f43ea5715d8c227 data-tgev-label=entertainment data-tgev-metric=ev>SAS instructor names most disappointing Aussie celebrity</a></b></p><p>“However this is a reality TV show featuring celebrities ranging from <i>Love Island</i> contestants, ex-sports stars and a convicted drug smuggler. I get they are putting them through SAS training, but it’s still a reality TV show, with no actual combat at the end.</p><p>“Once again it’s just an opinion, I felt uneasy watching it because of the work we have done in the DV space. Everyone will have a different view and I respect that, however I still think we don’t need more idolised sports stars hitting women on TV for ANY reason.”</p><p><i>SAS Australia</i> contestant, Roxy Jacenko, also had an issue with the fight.</p><p>“I take my hat off to Sabrina for choosing the Honey Badger,” Jacenko said on KIIS FM. “She was the biggest girl in terms of height and weight.</p><p>“But you know what I think is disgusting? The Honey Badger had a choice. Should he have hit her back? Absolutely not,” she said.</p><p><i>SAS Australia continues tonight on Channel 7 at 7.30pm</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmS%2Fpq3LoquyZaSrfLSt0maYrqukp66ttcBmrqGZpGLEor%2FNrWSsoJ%2Bsu26w1Kugp59dnbyvsdhmmZqcl5q%2FbrLIoJ%2BtZaOYsq%2BxjqecsKtdqMGwvthomJ2dY2yGeYPFcmdvamRnhqd9xZpramhkbYRyfZifaps%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./steve-kroschel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html>&#171;&nbsp;Steve Kroschel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a>
