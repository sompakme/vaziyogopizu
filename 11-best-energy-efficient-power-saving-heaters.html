But not all heaters are required to have a rating displayed, so you may have to look at the power saving features on the model instead.</p><p><b>• Size: </b>The watts (W) or kilowatts (kW) listed shows how strong your heater will be. Generally, you will only need a more powerful model if you live in a particularly cold climate or plan on using it in a large open space. It’s important to buy the right size heater because the harder it needs to work to reach the set temperature, the more electricity the appliance will end up using.</p><p><b>• Type of heater:</b> Certain types of heaters are better suited for personal heating rather than for warming up entire rooms, while others are more cost-effective if they run for longer periods.</p><p><b>• Thermostat:</b> Use the thermostat function to maintain the set temperature and prevent it from fluctuating. According to <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Energy.gov.au</a>, a temperature increase of just one degree Celsius can add up to 10 per cent to your energy usage.</p><p><b>• Timer:</b> Most portable heaters have a timer function that lets you schedule when you want to use the heater, so you don’t need to worry about turning it off before bed.</p><p>• <b>Cost: </b>Less energy efficient heaters are usually cheaper upfront, so you will need to decide if you’re willing to fork out extra at the store in exchange for a pricier model that’s potentially much cheaper to use over time.</p><p><b id=U812578259378ZoG>BEST BUDGET ENERGY EFFICIENT HEATERS</b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>The <a class=body-link href=# title=www.amazon.com.au rel=sponsored>De’Longhi Tower Fan Heater</a> is a quiet performer, boasting a Silence System to ensure it operates with minimal noise.</p><p>It uses ceramic technology to “self-regulate” by adjusting how much energy it uses, based on the temperature. So, the closer the room temperature is compared to your desired temperature, the less electricity (and money) it will end up using.</p><p>This portable heater is a good option if you only need something to keep you warm at your desk, since it’s great at spreading heat in a particular direction. This way, there’s no need to waste energy heating an entire room when you only need it in one spot.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>For spot heating, convection heaters like this <a class=body-link href=# title=www.amazon.com.au rel=sponsored>Dimplex</a> model are great for providing direct and constant warmth.</p><p>This portable heater has two heat settings (1kW and 2kW) and room thermostatic control to set and automatically maintain the desired temperature.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>Another affordable buy is this portable electric heater from <a class=body-link href=# title=t.cfjump.com rel=sponsored>Spector</a>, which offers 2000W of heating power and oscillates 70 degrees to help spread the warmth around the room.</p><p>It has two heat settings (high and low), an eight-hour timer, LED digital display as well as the standard tip-over switch and overheat protection function.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=www.betta.com.au rel=sponsored>Heller’s portable heater</a> is another budget-friendly way to warm up this winter, featuring two heat settings (750W and 1500W), a ceramic heating element and a quiet DC motor.</p><p>Most online reviews suggest it’s good bang for buck, especially for small rooms.</p><p>“A solid little heater that does a great job at heating my small bedroom. It comes with a setting to use just the fan, so it can be used as a basic fan in hot weather too,” a reviewer wrote.</p><p><b id=U812578259378suD>BEST ENERGY EFFICIENT HEATER FOR EXTENDED PERIODS</b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>“Ready, set and go” is one way to describe this <a class=body-link href=# title=myer.sjv.io rel=sponsored>De’Longhi 11-fin oil column heater</a>, thanks to the adjustable room thermostat that automatically maintains your desired temperature.</p><p>The electric heater has three heat settings, along with a 24-hour timer and snap-lock castor wheels for convenience.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>This <a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>Dimplex oil-free column heater</a> has a radiator design that supposedly makes it 30 per cent more energy efficient than other traditional oil heaters from the brand.</p><p>Regular oil-filled models can take a long time to warm up since it first needs to wait for the oil to reach the right temperature. But this unit is designed to use less energy by immediately converting electricity into heat, resulting in a shorter heat-up time.</p><p>Plus, as a safety bonus, this oil-free heater doesn’t contain a flammable substance (i.e. oil).</p><p><b id=U812578259378y2G>BEST ENERGY EFFICIENT GAS HEATERS</b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>For an efficient gas heater, Rinnai is one of the brands to check out. Unflued units like the <a class=body-link href=# title=t.cfjump.com rel=sponsored>Rinnai Avenger 25 Convector Heater</a> are also typically cheaper to run than gas flued heaters. This portable gas heater has a 5.8-star energy efficiency rating plus several convenient features, including adjustable temperature settings, an eco-mode and a programmable timer.</p><p>“We had a Rinnai Granada for 25 years and decided on getting the Rinnai Avenger as a replacement. We certainly weren’t let down as it’s a step up on our trusted old heater. Heats our open plan house within minutes, operating quietly and efficiently. More versatile too as you can adjust the temperature better too,” praised a reviewer.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>Another option from <a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>Rinnai is the Enduro 13 Convector natural gas heater</a>, which similarly comes with a 5.8 energy efficiency rating and is ideal for smaller spaces. If you want to keep the heater on for long periods, the model offers an economy mode to help minimise running costs by gradually reducing the heat setting once the room has maintained the set temperature for one hour. While this Rinnai portable heater is recommended for smaller spaces, some reviewers have found it powerful enough to cover a decent chunk of their home.</p><p>“Amazing. Warms quickly and heats the entire house,” a shopper posted.</p><p><b id=U812578259378pdH>BEST REVERSE CYCLE AIR CONDITIONERS FOR HEATING</b></p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>Hisense</a> packs a few power saving features in this split system air conditioner, including a 360-degree full DC inverter technology and an Eco Mode that lets you save up to 30 per cent more electricity compared to older models from the brand.</p><p>Another standout function is its self-cleaning technology, which is designed to reduce the need for cleaning and maintenance.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:</b></p><p>This <a class=body-link href=# title=prf.hn rel=sponsored>3.2kW Kelvinator reverse-cycle split system air conditioner</a> boasts a five-star energy efficiency rating for both cooling and heating, making it a perfect appliance all-year round – talk about being efficient.</p><p>During winter, you can take advantage of the 3.2kW heating capacity, 12 fan speeds, Demand Response capability and HEPA and ion filters.</p><p><b id=U812578259378oGB>WHICH TYPE OF HEATER IS THE CHEAPEST TO RUN?</b></p><p>According to <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Canstar Blue</a>, oil heaters and ceramics typically use the least amount of energy and are the cheapest to run compared to other electric heaters. Although it seems any electric heater seems to be the way to go, with the comparison site reporting they can add between $104 and $210 to your power bill while gas heaters can set you back up to $338 during winter.</p><p><b id=U81257825937842B>WHICH TYPE OF HEATER IS THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT?</b></p><p>To find out which type of heater consumes the least electricity, you’ll need to consider how you’re planning on using the appliance. Here’s a quick breakdown on what different units are best suited to:</p><p><b>Convector heaters</b></p><p>Convection heaters are great for warming an entire room for a long period of time.</p><p><b>Oil column heaters</b></p><p>Oil column heaters are ideal for people who prefer to leave their heater on overnight or for an extended period of time (i.e. longer than three hours) because they’re great at heating an entire room and staying warm after it’s been switched off. Some believe this is the cheapest type of heater to buy and run since it doesn’t need to power a fan to circulate heat, but they can take longer to warm up (which uses more energy and money).</p><p><b>Ceramic heaters</b></p><p>Typically small and lightweight, this is the best option if you want to keep a heater nearby for spot heating. Ceramic heaters also don’t use too much electricity since they get warm fast, but they don’t retain heat well so you might get cold a few minutes after turning it off.</p><p><b>Tower heaters</b></p><p>Tower heaters usually come with a bunch of customisable settings, giving you more control over your energy usage. These are better suited for small rooms.</p><p><b>Fan heaters</b></p><p>Fan heaters heat up quickly and are best suited for spot heating. But not all models are energy efficient and can be pricey to use, especially if you plan on leaving it on for a while.</p><p><b>Gas heaters</b></p><p>Gas heaters heat up quickly and are powerful enough to warm an entire apartment and open shared spaces. But they need to be professionally installed and serviced every two years, and bring potential safety risks.</p><p><b>Reverse cycle split system air conditioner</b></p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Reverse cycle air conditioners are a great investment because they usually come with an energy efficiency rating, along with several power saving features. Plus, they can be used to heat and cool throughout the year!</p><p>Want to find the best <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=9f9d7c5da856d26504cfc5e70913d066 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>oil column heaters</a> and the <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=038994c0a2ed650163c734352394b39c data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>best electric fireplaces</a>?
