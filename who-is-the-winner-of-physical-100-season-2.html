"A lot was going through my mind in terms of how am I going to live my life if that were the case going forward. At that time my mother had come to Seoul to look after me for about a month. Watching her take care of me and be there for me, I thought to myself, I cannot collapse here. I'm very proud of what I've done to overcome that time.
