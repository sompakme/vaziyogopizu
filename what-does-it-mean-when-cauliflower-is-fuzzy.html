Overmature cauliflower, or cauliflower exposed to extreme heat while growing may taste somewhat bitter, but don't assume all cauliflower with fuzzy heads will taste bitter.<h2>Why does my cauliflower look furry?</h2>The likely culprit is a spike in temperatures that top out at 80°F around the time of curd formation.

The physical manifestation of this is a fuzzy appearance.<h2>How can you tell if cauliflower is going bad?</h2>Telltale signs of cauliflower spoilage<p>Other telltale signs of spoilage for cauliflower include mold, off-smells, slimy texture, or soft spots.
