She finished 4th and was a jury member in Season 12: Panama, she came 3rd and was a jury member in Season 16: Micronesia, and she came 17th in Season 20: Heroes Vs. Villains. She says she’s now a lot older and wiser, and is also physically fitter. She plans on getting less emotionally involved!</p><h4>James “J.T.” Thomas Jr.</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-1.jpg alt='James "J.T."

Villains. He plans to pay a lot more attention to who he picks as allies early on in the game.</p><h4>Andrea Boehlke</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-7.jpg alt="Andrea Boehlke" width=773 height=958 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Andrea, 27, from New York, NY, finished fifth and was a jury member on Season 22: Redemption Island, and finished seventh and was a jury member on Season 26: Caramoan. She says she’s older and wiser so fancies her chances much more, and plans to play an aggressive game while trying to stay under the radar.</p><h4>Brad Culpepper</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-13.jpg alt="Brad Culpepper" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Brad, 47, from Tampa, FL, came 15th on Season 27: Blood Vs. Water. His game plan is to start off much slower than last time, and get more involved as things heat up.</p><h4>Sierra Dawn Thomas</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-14.jpg alt="Sierra Dawn-Thomas" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sierra, 29, from Roy, UT, came 5th and was a jury member on Season 30: White, Blue, No Collar. Her biggest regret from last time she played is not making a big move when she should have, so this time round she’s going to be cut-throat and do whatever it takes in a bid to go all the way.</p><h4>Oscar “Ozzy” Lusth</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-3.jpg alt='Oscar "Ozzy" Lusth' width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Oscar, 34, from Venice, CA, is a Survivor regular, having appeared three times previously. He was runner up on Season 13: Cook Islands, came 9th and was a jury member on Season 16: Micronesia, and finished 4th and was a jury member on Season 23: South Pacific. He says his early game, and the alliances he makes at the start, are what he’s going to change this time round.</p><h4>Debbie Wanner</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-4.jpg alt="Debbie Wanner" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Debbie, 51, from Reading, PA, came 9th on Season 32: Brains Vs. Brawn Vs. Beauty, the series which has most repeat contestants this time round. She plans to be much more aware of how other people view things she says, and try and reach out to as many people as possible without losing sincerity and decency.</p><h4>Tai Trang</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-20.jpg alt="Tai Trang" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Tai, 52, from San Francisco, CA, was 2nd runner-up in Season 32: Brain Vs. Brawn Vs. Beauty, but says he’s much more confident about how to play this time around. He plans to spend a lot more time thinking about where he stands in the tribe, and focus more on winning rather than creating friendships.</p><h4>Sarah Lacina</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-12.jpg alt="Sarah Lacina" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sarah, 32, from Marion, IA, came 11th and was a jury member on Season 28: Brains Vs. Brawn Vs. Beauty. She says the main thing she regrets from last time around is sticking to her morals — and this time round anything goes, as long as she wins!</p><h4>Zeke Smith</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-11.jpg alt="Zeke Smith" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Moustachioed Zeke, 28, from Brooklyn, NY, finished 9th and was a jury member in Season 33: Millenials Vs. Gen X. He says he’s still pretty much the same as when he last appeared, and says he doesn’t know what went wrong last time apart from him maybe being too “flashy”. This time around he plans to be a little more subdued.</p><h2>Mana Tribe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-6.jpg><p>The original Mana Tribe will be made up of…</p><h4>Michaela Bradshaw</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-8.jpg alt="Michaela Bradshaw" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Michaela, 25, from Fort Worth, TX, came 14th on Season 33: Millenials Vs. Gen X. She says that her biggest problem last time around was that she didn’t pay enough attention to how others perceived her.</p><h4>Malcolm Freberg</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-2.jpg alt="Malcolm Freberg" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Malcolm, 29, from Hermosa Beach, CA, came 4th and was a jury member on Season 25: Philippines, and came 9th and was a jury member on Season 26: Caramoan. He says he’s older, wiser and “a little” fatter since he last appeared. He says he’s keeping the same tactics, but is going to just play better.</p><h4>Hali Ford</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-9.jpg alt="Hali Ford" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Hali, 26, from Knoxville, TN, came 11th and was a jury member on Season 30: White, Blue, No Collar. She says she know understands herself a lot more than she did first time around. She says she is proud of “nothing” from her appearance last time around — and is determined to prove herself. She’s become a criminal defense attorney since her last appearance.</p><h4>Jeff Varner</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-18.jpg alt="Jeff Varner" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jeff, 50, from High Point, NC, came 10th in Season 2: Australia, and came 17th on Season 31: Second Chances. He says he’s changed a lot since he last appeared on the show, and is fitter, smarter, and less emotional. He says he plans to play the long game, and also enjoy himself more.</p><h4>Troy “Troyzan” Robertson</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-5.jpg alt='Troy "Troyzan" Robertson' width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Troy, 54, from Miami, FL, is the oldest contestant in the Season 34 cast. He last appeared in Season 24: One World, when he came 8th and was a jury member. He plans to win by outwitting the other contestants, and keeping someone close to him at all times who’s a bigger target than he is. He also plans to try and keep his cards closer to his chest than he did when he first appeared.</p><h4>Sandra Diaz-Twine</h4><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/survivor-cast-16.jpg alt="Sandra Diaz-Twine" width=773 height=1160 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sandra, 41, from Fayetteville, NC, won both Season 7: Pearl Islands and Season 20: Heroes Vs.

Brawn Vs. Beauty, after suffering heatstroke.
