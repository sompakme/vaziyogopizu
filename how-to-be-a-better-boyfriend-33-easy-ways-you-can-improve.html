Little things like asking her how her day is going and sending her texts throughout the day will make her feel special.</p><h3>3. Give her space</h3><p class=align-left>One of the crucial things a boyfriend should do for her girlfriend is give her space. Girls need space from time to time to do their things.

Take her on dates</h3><p class=align-left>Spending quality time with <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1208107-how-test-girlfriend-loves-truly.html href=#>your girlfriend</a> is what makes a good boyfriend. Set aside time within your schedule to hang out together alone. This will make your relationship stronger and bring you closer.</p><h3>5. Show her respect</h3><p class=align-left>Being playful and teasing her is great for the relationship. However, girls appreciate it when their boyfriends are respectful.

Girls like hanging around people with a great sense of humour, so make her laugh.</p><h3>7. Be honest</h3><p class=align-left>Honesty is the best policy, and your girlfriend will <a href=#>love you</a> more if you are an honest person. Nobody wants to be with someone who lies or constantly omits things that that are important. The same applies to you; you must always be honest if you want to <a href=#>be a better girlfriend</a>.</p><h3>8. Decisiveness</h3><p class=align-left>A good boyfriend knows what he wants in life, no matter how big or small it may be. He knows and understands his limits but isn't afraid to take risks. He should be ready to commit and take on responsibilities in the relationship</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ed916224f0d49e33.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most awesome suggestions for long distance relationship gifts</span></p></a><h3>9. Build trust</h3><p class=align-left>One answer to how to be a perfect boyfriend is to be trustworthy. Be a man who keeps your word. One of the best things you can do for your girlfriend is to keep your word. If you say something, make sure you go through with it; otherwise, she'll fall out of love with you.</p><h3>10. Make her a priority</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7cb3f3af176c210c.jpg><p class=align-left>Your girlfriend should be your priority.

Be sensitive to her needs</h3><p class=align-left>There's no greater aphrodisiac than a man sensitive to his woman's needs. Women like to feel like they matter to their men, which is evident when their needs are taken care of. So ask her what she needs and act on it.</p><h3>12. Be a good listener</h3><p class=align-left>Listen keenly to your girlfriend if you want to know how to become a better boyfriend. This means paying attention and not being too busy on your phone when she is talking. When your girl is ranting about her woes, she is looking for an ear, not a magic cure.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/38110785815b499e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>170+ best sweet good morning messages to make her smile</span></p></a><h3>13. Show her you are interested in her</h3><p class=align-left>No girl wants a boyfriend who's just there for appearances. Make an effort to show her that you care about her and you are interested in her. Don't be scared of trying something new if it means making her happy.</p><h3>14. Surprise her</h3><p class=align-left>Being spontaneous is one way to <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1208107-how-test-girlfriend-loves-truly.html href=#>spice up your relationship</a>. Surprise her on her <a href=#>birthday</a>, buy her lunch and drop it off at work, show up with flowers on a random day etc. This works like magic, and your girlfriend will be wowed.</p><h3>15. Be confident</h3><p class=align-left>There is nothing as attractive as a confident man. A confident man knows himself inside and out. He loves how he lives his life and doesn't care what other people say about him. Girls are very proud of their boyfriends when they show confidence.</p><h3>16. Support her emotionally</h3><p class=align-left>Girls are emotional and like to know they can lean on you for emotional support. So be there for her no matter what happens, good or bad. When a girl feels someone has her back, it shows how much you love her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b737661fe0be63e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>70+ interesting questions to ask your boyfriend when bored</span></p></a><h3>17.

Introduce her to your people</h3><p class=align-left>Your girlfriend will have doubts when you don't introduce her to your friends and family. She may think you're not proud of her as your girlfriend. Make her feel special by letting her meet the people around you if you haven't already.</p><h3>19. Correct her when she goes astray</h3><p class=align-left>Don't be a yes man and reward bad behaviour. Instead, make sure you express yourself when she is wrong and subtly correct her. Be a positive influence on her life.</p><h3>20. Be loyal</h3><p class=align-left>Girls rate loyalty as the top quality in a man. So always reassure her and make her feel safe.

Groom well</h3><p class=align-left>Some men are from a school of thought that says you don't have to make an effort in a relationship. But, if anything, you should step it up. Ensure you look your best and leave your partner drooling. Make the rest of the girls jealous they didn't get you first.</p><h3>23. Be a good communicator</h3><p class=align-left>You've heard it a million times communication is the backbone of a good relationship. Unfortunately, some men are poor communicators but let this not be your excuse for not communicating. Instead, ask her how you can improve and tell her what you expect from her.</p><h3>24.
