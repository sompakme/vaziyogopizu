addition to being named a five-time all-star.&nbsp;Domestically, he won gold medals with the United States Men’s National Team at the 2010 FIBA ​​World Championship and the 2012 Summer Olympics.</span></p><p><span>Learn more about him in areas like his wife, girlfriend, body measurements, and his remarkable weight loss.&nbsp;For those who don’t know him too well, let’s take a quick look at his background and career.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Background and information on Kevin Love’s early career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kevin Wesley Love was born on the 7th day of September 1988 in Santa Monica, California as the middle child of three born to Stan (father) and Karen (mother) Love.&nbsp;Her siblings are Collin (older brother) and Emily Love (younger sister).&nbsp;His other family members were the founder of the band – The Beach Boys, Mike Love who is his uncle and Kathleen McCartney Hearst is his aunt and a former triathlete.</span></p><p><span>Growing up, he spent his childhood in Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was playmate with fellow NBA star Klay Thompson.&nbsp;Kevin, like every other professional NBA player today, started playing basketball in his early school days.&nbsp;He played for the Lake Oswego Lakers which he led to the 2005 state championship games but unfortunately they were eliminated by Jesuit High School.</span></p><p><span>The following summer, he played for the Southern California All-Stars and won three MVP awards with them.&nbsp;He concluded his high school basketball career as the all-time leading scorer in Oregon basketball history with a total of 2,626 points for himself.</span></p><p><span>His college career began with UCLA where he obtained permission from Walt Hazzard to wear the number 42 jersey which was previously retired in Hazzard’s honor.&nbsp;At UCLA, he regularly sought advice from retired but not tired legends like Bill Walton and John Wooden.</span></p><p><span>In 2008, he led UCLA to the regular-season Pac-10 conference championship in addition to the conference tournament championship, and a No. 1 seed in the 2008 NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Tournament. The season’s end saw Kevin Love named consensus first-team All American, Pac-10 Player of the Year, Pac-10 and deservingly Pac-10 Freshman of the Year.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: wife, girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Prior to his current relationship, Kevin was previously in a relationship with Cody Harrell Horn and Elise Novak at different times.</span></p><p><span>Elsie was probably his first girlfriend as they dated while in college.&nbsp;Elsie was the cheerleader at UCLA and their relationship lasted six years.</span></p><p><span>His second known girlfriend was Cody who was born on June 12, 1988, in Los Angeles as the daughter of Cindy (a former model and actress) and Alan F. Horn (an entertainment executive) is a model and actress just like his mother.&nbsp;She studied at Harvard-Westlake School and graduated in 2006. She starred in the movie&nbsp;</span><span>Overthrown</span><span>&nbsp;as Lynetta Loski in 2010. She also played the role of Michelle in the horror thriller&nbsp;</span><span>Demonic</span><span>&nbsp;and also&nbsp;</span><span>Magic Mike</span><span>&nbsp;in 2012.</span></p><p><span>Kevin’s current girlfriend and likely future wife is Kate Bock is also a model.&nbsp;She was discovered by a modeling business when she was 12 at a local swimming pool where she had gone to entertain herself.&nbsp;She studied at West Vancouver Secondary School and after graduation she went to Paris to pursue her career.&nbsp;She is known for appearing on the covers of magazines like Maxim and Elle and has modeled for Victoria’s Secret.</span></p><p><span>Kevin Love and Kate Bock’s relationship has been going strong for quite some time now, even though both have been busy pursuing their careers.&nbsp;They live in different cities because of this, but they make time to be together when they can.&nbsp;There aren’t any rumors suggesting their relationship got unhealthy because of it, so it’s not something fans of both celebrities should worry about.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body stats: height, body measurements, weight loss</span></strong></h2><ul><li><span>Height: 6 feet 10 inches or 208 cm</span></li><li><span>Body weight: 114 kg or 251 lbs</span></li><li><span>Chest – 47 inches or 119 cm</span></li><li><span>Arms / Biceps – 16 inches or 41 cm</span></li><li><span>Height – 37 inches or 94 cm</span></li></ul><p><span>To be fit and active in his sports, Love had to watch his weight closely.&nbsp;He entered the league weighing around 270 pounds, but as thin as he always was.&nbsp;He increased his workouts over the summer with fitness-focused players like Kevin Durant and Russel Westbrook in addition to doing yoga and following a plant-based diet.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGijlau2r3nLqK2eZaees6Z5xqKppZ6inrKvsIyhnKKfmKl6o7vDsmSmnZGowrOxzJ6lratdrLKqs8etZKWno6h8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kind-man-gives-airport-piano-player-n4-1m-says-he-made-music-from-his-heart.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kind Man Gives Airport Piano Player N4.1m, Says He Made Music From His Heart</a>
