They can also produce a lot of drool. Their chin can get wet, and they may wipe their mouth on surfaces as well.<h2>Can pet rats eat peanut butter cookies?</h2>Many food items that are harmless to people are potentially very hazardous to rats, such as peanut butter, onions, corn, chocolate, yogurt drops, cookies and blue cheese.

If not, firmly massage the chest for a couple of seconds and then blow in their nose again.<h2>Can pet rats throw up?</h2>Rodents can't vomit at all. That's right: Squirrels, mice, rats, gophers, beavers and all other rodents are incapable of throwing up.<h2>Why does my rat keep yawning?</h2>Yawning frequency could be a reliable indication of a rat's physiological state, as yawning rate and defecation rate (an index of emotional reactivity) showed a consistent negative association in cage mate rats, so that frequent yawning was a genuine indication (i.e. a cue) of a low-arousal state of calm.<h2>How can I tell if my rat is dying?</h2>However, one of the first signs you may notice when your rat is dying; is the lack of appetite and thirst. Their bodies are shutting down. They no longer have the sensation of hunger or thirst. Food is not essential for your rat, they can go for 2 or 3 days without eating anything.<h2>Why is my rat dragging his back legs?</h2>As rats age, they can become prone to back leg weakness.
