The 34-year-old player is currently preparing to make a deep playoff run with the Suns alongside Chris Paul and Devin Booker following his stint with Brooklyn. In 2019, he signed a four-year $164 million contract with the Nets, which made him one of the five highest-paid players in the NBA. Along with this, Sun's star player has many off-the-court endorsement deals. Here's a look at the net worth of Kevin Durant.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-durant-s-net-worth>Durant's Net Worth</h2></span><p>BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS - NOVEMBER 24: Kevin Durant #7 of the Brooklyn Nets dunks the ball during the first half against the Boston Celtics at TD Garden on November 24, 2021 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Durant is one of the highest-paid basketball players in the league. Along with the $42 million he makes from his annual NBA salary, Durant also has many endorsement deals and investment opportunities, earning additional tens of millions of dollars per year. Between June 2019 and June 2020, Durant reportedly brought in $65 million through various business ventures. Furthermore, Durant is an avid investor in the tech world. He co-founded ThirtyFive Ventures with Rich Kleiman, which has invested in over 80 start-up companies including PostMates.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-durant-s-basketball-salary>Durant's Basketball Salary</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 27: Kevin Durant #7 of the Brooklyn Nets heads for the net as Mikal Bridges #25 of the Phoenix Suns defends at Barclays Center on November 27, 2021 in New York City.

Durant began making more than $20 million per year during the 2015-16 season with the Thunder. With an increase in <a href=# rel>the NBA's salary cap,</a> Durant's salary has exponentially grown over the past few years. During this season, Kevin Durant reportedly made $44 million which contributed to his net worth. By the 2025-26 season, Durant is projected to make $54 million per year, according to experts. As Durant is still competing at a very high level, that number will likely increase even more once his current contract expires.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-contract-with-nike>Contract With <a href=# class=text-word>Nike</a></h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 25: Detail of the Nike shoes worn by Kevin Durant #7 of the Brooklyn Nets during the first half against the Washington Wizards at Barclays Center on October 25, 2021 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.

(Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)</p><p>Kevin Durant first signed with Nike when he joined the NBA. He signed his first deal with the company for $60 million over seven years. After his MVP season in 2014, Durant re-signed with Nike on a reported ten-year $300 million deal. Kevin Durant has sixteen <a href=# rel>signature shoes with Nike</a> and is probably the second most popular NBA player signed to Nike behind <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Lebron James</a>. Durant currently makes $26 million per year from his Nike deal.</p><p>Durant's Nike deal also guarantees him $50 million upon his retirement. Many companies such as Nike have begun awarding lifetime deals to their signature athletes, so Durant could be awarded even more money long after his NBA career ends. Despite this, Durant's current deal with Nike runs out next year. It is very possible that he resigns from his deal with the company due to their seventeen-year relationship and success. However, regardless of where Durant signs, his shoe endorsement deal will likely grow even larger in the coming year.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-off-the-court-investments>Off-The-Court Investments</h2></span><p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA - SEPTEMBER 19: Durant Company/Thirty Five Media Partner Rich Kleiman (L) and NBA Player and Durant Company/Thirty Five Media Partner Kevin Durant speak onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017 at Pier 48 on September 19, 2017 in San Francisco, California.

According to Forbes, the Phoenix Suns star has invested in over 80 companies through his firm ThirtyFive Ventures. Durant founded ThirtyFive Ventures with his agent/manager Rich Kleinman. In 2019, Durant reportedly made $35 million from off-the-court investments.</p><p>Durant owns small stakes in Postmates and the investment app Acorns. Durant is also involved in many sports-related ventures including an equity stake in the Overtime app. Along with this, Durant purchased a 5% stake in the Philadelphia Union of the MLS. Recent additions to ThirtyFive Ventures include OpenSea. Durant is also backing SeatGeek's SPAC merger. Durant is also behind the media brand Boardroom and was a producer on "Two Distant Strangers," which took home the Oscar for best live-action short film in 2021.</p><p>In addition to his investments, Durant also makes over $40 million from sponsors. Durant landed a sponsorship deal with Gatorade and other companies, as well. He also recently struck sponsorship deals with Coinbase, NBA Top Shot, and Weedmaps. In addition to this, Durant's media company has production deals with Fox, ESPN, Apple, and Showtime.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-real-estate>Real Estate</h2></span><p>Along with his basketball salary, endorsements, and investments, Durant has also owned tons of real estate across the country during his time in the NBA. Durant reportedly owns a number of properties in the Oklahoma City area due to his time with the Thunder. In 2013, Durant listed his house in the upper-class Club Villa neighborhood in Oklahoma City for $1.95 million, though he later slashed the price and sold the property for $1.1 million.</p><p>In 2018, he spent around $12 million on a beach-front home in Malibu, California. By June of the next year, Durant sold the home for $12.15 million dollars. The buyer of Durant's Malibu mansion was Anthony Zuiker, who is the creator of the CSI television franchise. In July 2021, Durant purchased a $15.6 million mansion in Hidden Hills, California. Many celebrities own property in the same neighborhood including <a href=# class=text-word rel>Madonna</a>, the Kardashians, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a> (who sold his property in 2022), and John Stamos.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-durant-s-monetary-future>Durant's Monetary <a href=# class=text-word>Future</a></h2></span><p>Durant has the potential to increase his net worth significantly over the next decade. Along with an increase in his NBA contract, Durant is poised to sign a new shoe deal and continue building his investment portfolio. While the basketball superstar's NBA career could end in the next ten years, it seems that through investments and endorsements, Durant will continue his financial success.</p><p><a href=# rel>[Via]</a> [Via]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma313hZVmop6umaN6pcHRmqWtq12jsrV51qipraA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-was-tiger-king-s-erik-cowie-and-how-did-he-die.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who was Tiger King's Erik Cowie and how did he die?</a>
