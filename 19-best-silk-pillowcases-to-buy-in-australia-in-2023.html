It does everything from protecting your hair and keeping it shiny and healthy to looking after your skin with its hypo-allergenic, antifriction and breathable qualities. It also is a great option, if you tend to overheat at night. No need to flip over the pillow to the cold side anymore.</p><p><i><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>SHOP NOW</a></b></i></p><h2><span class=h2><b>HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU WASH SILK PILLOWCASES?</b></span></h2><p>When you think about it, we spend almost one third of our life in contact with our pillowcase, so washing it regularly is important. It’s recommended to wash your pillowcase every two or three days – at the very least weekly – to ensure the area stays clean from makeup and sweat build-up, which could then have an impact on your skin’s health.</p><h2><span class=h2><b>ARE SILK PILLOWCASES WORTH IT?</b></span></h2><p>Due to the luxe material they are made from, silk pillowcases are often more costly than your average bed linen. However, the material comes with benefits other than just simply feeling fantastic. When we sleep, we toss and turn creating lots of friction and this friction can impact us in two ways – it tosses our hair around, and pulls our skin. Due to the smooth surface, silk pillowcases create less friction, in turn theoretically improving hair and skin. They are also hypo-allergenic, breathable and chemical-free, making them perfect for sensitive skin and those who suffer from allergies. The silk also regulates heat meaning it is cool on skin, helping you sleep better.</p><p>While there isn’t much research in silk pillowcases themselves, experts believe there is no harm trying to add them to your routine as a supplement along with other hair and skin treatments.</p><h2><span class=h2><b>CAN YOU SLEEP WITH WET HAIR ON A SILK PILLOWCASE?</b></span></h2><p>Sleeping with wet hair on your silk pillowcase can actually be very beneficial. Unlike cotton that often robs your hair of moisture, silk won’t absorb your lock’s moisture allowing it to stay more hydrated while the slippery surface can help keep strands from tangling reducing frizz.</p><h2><span class=h2><b>HOW SHOULD YOU WASH YOUR SILK PILLOWCASE?</b></span></h2><p>Always read the label for instructions on your particular product but generally speaking, silk pillowcases are machine washable on a cool/delicate cycle. It’s recommended to put it in a delicate wash bag and to use a pH neutral liquid detergent and/or fabric softener. Do not tumble dry and only iron on low heat.</p><p><b>More Best Home Coverage</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=ccd77cb3828a4620325b148299d301f1 data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best vacuum cleaners to buy in Australia</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=cb1c2993e90ba2ee0ffd4b9a891aed4e data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Best memory foam mattresses</a></p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p><a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=cd639fd8831e42b4446bfd60b714339d data-tgev-label=checkout data-tgev-metric=ev>Top rated weighted blankets</a></p><p>If you’re after more bedroom essentials, be sure to check out our edit of the <a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=a3bd50995f537906133c97bf650d8160 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>best bamboo sheets</a>, or our roundup of the <a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=4fbd864def049ed9f5d95f5db13655d4 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>best memory foam pillows</a> for a dreamy night’s sleep.</p><p>On the hunt for a bargain?

She is passionate about finding and recommending fashion items that are great quality and value, ensuring you can wear them for years and save money in the long run. Her interest in skincare came from first-hand experience of searching for the best products for acne-prone skin and trying a long list of products in the process. Since joining the team she has tested everything from hair tools to jeans (spoiler alert: she loved them both). She is always on the lookout for the next viral TikTok trend to put to the test.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=best-of-sleep data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Best Of: Sleep</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7wqGcnKOfqsFwtM6mnGaZnpl6qK3RnZynZ5KasbO7zqZmm52Umbavs46bnKysXai2rbeMqaClpJ%2BssKK%2FxKxmp52nqHq0wM6rsGhxkWuCeK2QbWqeamVphXZ%2FkHBucG2TloN6fJdtaptxZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./a-look-into-the-tragedy-at-the-rolling-stones-altamont-concert.html>&#171;&nbsp;A Look Into The Tragedy At The Rolling Stones' Altamont Concert</a>
