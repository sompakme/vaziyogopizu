At least, that's how it went for Richard Ramirez, dubbed the "Night Stalker," and Doreen Lioy. The pair tied the knot in 1996, while Ramirez was living on death row in California's San Quentin State Prison after being convicted of a shocking string of murders, sexual assaults, robberies, carjackings, and more throughout Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1985.</p><p>A new Netflix docuseries,&nbsp;Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer, follows L.A. detectives Frank Salerno and Gil Carrillo's investigation of Ramirez's seemingly random crime spree, ending with his successful capture in August 1985. However, that's where the series ends, without going into detail about Ramirez's tumultuous trial, sentencing, and the barely 24 years he spent on death row, including his relationship with Lioy. To fill in the blanks, here's everything you need to know about Lioy and her marriage to the Night Stalker.</p><h2 id=who-is-doreen-lioy-3>Who is Doreen Lioy?</h2><p>When she began her relationship with Ramirez, Lioy was a freelance teen magazine editor from Burbank, California.

It's been a painful event for the family."</p><p>Ramirez proposed in 1988, but the two weren't married until 1996, Lioy told the&nbsp;Examiner&nbsp;around the time of their wedding at San Quentin, which was attended by Ramirez's brother, sister, and niece, lawyers, and the author of a book claiming to outline Ramirez's innocence. At the 15-minute service, Lioy reportedly wore a short white dress and gave Ramirez a platinum band—because self-described Satanists don't wear gold, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-has-lioy-said-about-being-married-to-a-serial-killer-3>What has Lioy said about being married to a serial killer?</h2><p>After claiming to love Ramirez "more than anything in the world" in her 1996 interview with the&nbsp;Examiner, Lioy—then going by Doreen Ramirez—continued to unabashedly declare her love for the infamous Night Stalker in their ensuing years as husband and wife.

"I think he's really a great person. He's my best friend; he's my buddy."</p><p>As for how she was able to fall in love with a convicted murderer, Lioy's answer was simple: an unwavering belief in his innocence. "I just believe in him completely," she told CNN.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
