The characters in Because This Is My First Life are just like us–following their dreams, working in high-powered industries, all the while just barely reaping the benefits. Nam Sae-hee (Lee Min-ki) is a software developer working for a start-up who suffers from a mortgage that eats up all his disposable income. Yoon Ji-ho (Jung So-min) is a struggling screenwriter who dreams of developing her own K-dramas, but she’s relegated to being a writer’s assistant on mediocre shows. When the unlikely pair realize that a fake marriage would be mutually advantageous for both their financial situations and societal expectations, they decide to tie the knot. One thing leads to another and they’re unable to separate their contractual marriage from the real feelings that begin to develop.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/title/81167119 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/title/81167119 data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>watch it on netflix</a></p><h2 id=39-fight-for-my-way-39-2017-2>'Fight For My Way' (2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4wva4t3w8DXaXFNJDZqf2i-1920-80.jpeg><p>This drama follows that transformative period of the quarter-life crisis, as a quartet of friends make big changes in their professional and romantic lives.
