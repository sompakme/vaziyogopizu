"If you want a touchable, brushable finish, then a light-to-medium hold hairspray is the one for you!" shares hairstylist <a href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/jameemahmood/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Jamee Mahmood</a>. "If you want a locked-in style, go for a [strong hold] long-lasting hairspray. Choosing the right weight of hairspray for your specific hair and styling goals will ultimately give you your desired results."</li><li><strong>Hair type: </strong>Your hair type has a lot of say in which hairspray will work best for you. "A good rule of thumb is that the thinner and finer your hair is, usually a light or medium hold will do the trick. With thicker hair you will usually need (and can withstand) a stronger hold hairspray," notes Ellsworth. Michael adds that those with fine hair probably want to look for a hairspray with volume. "For chemically treated hair, you’ll choose something that’s paraben and sulfate-free. For beach waves, curls, or loose, sexy blowouts, I love using a heat-activated hairspray."</li><li><strong>Product type: </strong>Before grabbing a hairspray off the shelf, it's important to know what exactly it was made to do. "Not all hairsprays are created equal!" shares <a href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/thepaulaperalta/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Paula Peralta</a>, hairstylist and artistic director of heritage haircare&nbsp;brand John Paul Mitchell Systems. "There are working hairsprays and finishing hairsprays. A working spray builds texture and memory into the hair as you’re styling and a finishing spray is designed to add polish or protect hair from environmental issues, like humidity."</li><li><strong>Scent:</strong> Scent plays a major role in hairspray; even the "unscented" versions often have some sort of smell going on. If you're sensitive to smell or picky in any way, make sure you know what you're in for—and that you can handle a lingering scent—when picking out your product.</li></ul><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-hairspray-affects-your-hair><span>How Hairspray Affects Your Hair</span></h2><p>From childhood dance recitals to adult Halloween costumes, using hairspray at some point in your life is inevitable. With that, it's important to know how your hair is affected.</p><p>“Hairspray has been around since before we can even remember. There’s always been a way to control hair. But think about anything you try to control without having some type of flexibility: you’re subject to damaging that thing over time," Valcin says. If you're aware of the downsides, the stylist says it's not the worst product to apply to your hair. "But if you don’t know, it could be the worst thing you put in your hair."</p><p>Hairsprays are formulated with alcohol that soaks up the natural oils your scalp produces. That results in greasy, brittle hair that's subject to breakage, Valcin explains. As we know, hairsprays have alcohol in them. If your hair doesn’t have moisture, that alcohol will soak up the natural oil that your scalp produces. It will make the hair very greasy and very brittle, and the hair might be subject to breaking."</p><p>Before you apply your hairspray, make sure your hair is moisturized and happy. (Products like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-drugstore-leave-in-conditioners/>leave-in drugstore conditioners</a> can help.) When you start from a positive space, after effects such as frizz and breakage won't be nearly as intense.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-use-hairspray><span>How to Use Hairspray</span></h2><p>Hairspray can hold anything from slicked-back ponytails to loose, sexy blowouts. Before you spray, you're going to want to shake your product up. Then, hold the can (or bottle) anywhere from six to eight inches away from your strands and spray away.</p><p>"One of my favorite tips is to spray the section of hair with hairspray before you curl the hair," adds Peralta.

At that moment, it's best to treat your hair well.</p><p>"To remove hairspray from your hair, it would be good to use a moisturizing shampoo or a shampoo that’s oil-based," Valcin shares. "The moisture will break down the alcohol and it’ll be easy to wash away. Or, put a little bit of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/argan-oil-for-hair/>argan oil</a> or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-hair-brands/>Moroccan oil</a> on your hands and run them through your hair.
