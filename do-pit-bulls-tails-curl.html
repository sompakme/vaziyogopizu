Fear or surrender is shown by the tail being held between the legs.</p><p></p><h3>If you are licked by a dog, what does that mean?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Dogs also lick because they like the taste of their owner’s salted skin and because it is a matter of habit for them.
