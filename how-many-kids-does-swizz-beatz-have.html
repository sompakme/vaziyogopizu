Through various social media posts over the years, the public has gotten to witness the producer’s love for&nbsp;his son. Following in the steps of his father, the 23-year-old is now a rapper, producer, and DJ, going by the name “Note Marcato.” Nasir&nbsp;went viral back in 2020 for attending the Grammys with the skeleton face paint that became Note Marcato’s signature look. As aforementioned, he also stars beside his dad in the new Hulu show&nbsp;Drive with Swizz Beatz. All six episodes are now available on the streaming service.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kasseem-dean-jr-16>Kasseem Dean Jr. (16)</h2></span><p>In 2006,&nbsp;Swizz Beatz welcomed his&nbsp;second child and namesake, Kasseem Dean Jr.,&nbsp;with Mashonda Tifrere.&nbsp;Prior to Dean Jr.’s birth on December 22, 2006, Swizz Beatz and Tifrere had wed in 2004. While the two separated in 2008, they have&nbsp;maintained&nbsp;an amicable co-parenting relationship.&nbsp;Unlike his older brother, Dean Jr. seems to be taking a different route from music. He is a budding track and field star with a clear interest in fashion, and his father doesn’t hesitate to express his pride and love for him. Swizz Beatz is famous for openly celebrating his kids, and Dean Jr. is no exception.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicole-dean-15>Nicole Dean (15)</h2></span><p>Of his five kids, Nicole Dean is the only daughter Swizz Beatz has, and she was conceived by Jahna Sabastian.

Over a decade into her life now, Nicole has grown up spending a lot of time with her father and siblings. Never one to withhold love from his family, Swizz Beatz has showered Nicole with it over the years.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-egypt-daoud-dean-13>Egypt Daoud Dean (13)</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 07: (L-R) Swizz Beatz, Egypt Daoud Dean and Alicia Keys attend the 10th annual Keep A Child Alive Black Ball at Hammerstein Ballroom on November 7, 2013 in New York City.

Egypt Daoud is their first,&nbsp;and he was born on October 14, 2010, months after his parents married.&nbsp;In general, it would usually be too early to say what career path he would end up on. However,&nbsp;he has shared that he wants to be a basketball player.&nbsp;Despite his statement, <a href=# rel>Egypt has&nbsp;displayed an impressive affinity for music</a>&nbsp;as well, taking after both his parents. He wrote his first song at the age of six. Additionally, he received production credits on <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>’s 2016 compilation album,&nbsp;Untitled&nbsp;Unmastered.
